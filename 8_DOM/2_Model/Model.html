    Some Terms Used In DOM ->
    
    ~ Window Object ->

    The window object is the topmost object in the DOM hierarchy.
    It represents the browser window or frame that contains the web page.
    The window object is the global object in the browser's environment,
    meaning it contains properties and methods that allow you to interact
    with the browser itself, such as opening new windows, alerting messages,
    setting timeouts, and interacting with the DOM through the document object

    Example Properties/Methods ->

    window.alert(): Displays an alert box.
    window.setTimeout(): Calls a function after a specified delay.
    window.document: Refers to the document object that represents the web page.

    ~ Document Object->

    The document object is a property of the window object and represents the
    entire HTML document. It acts as an entry point to the content of the web
    page and provides methods and properties to interact with and manipulate
    the elements within the page.

    Example Properties/Methods ->

    document.getElementById(): Retrieves an element by its ID.
    document.querySelector(): Retrieves the first element that matches a CSS selector.
    document.createElement(): Creates a new HTML element.
