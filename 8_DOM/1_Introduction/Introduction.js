//  Document Object Model [DOM] -->

/*
    Introduction -->

    DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web
    documents. The DOM represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects,
    where each node is an element, attribute, or piece of text in the HTML document.

    When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a DOM of the page.
    The DOM allows programming languages (like JavaScript) to manipulate,
    structure, and style the content, layout, and appearance of the web page
    dynamically. This is essential for creating interactive and dynamic
    web applications.

    Why Study the DOM ?

    Dynamic Content Manipulation -->

    The DOM allows you to dynamically change the content of a webpage,
    such as updating text, images, and other elements without needing to
    reload the page.

    Event Handling -->

    By using the DOM, you can add event listeners to elements, making it
    possible to respond to user interactions like clicks, keyboard input,
    and more.

    Interactive Web Applications -->

    Understanding the DOM is key to developing interactive web applications.
    It allows you to create features like forms, sliders, modals, and animations.

    Cross-Browser Compatibility -->

    The DOM provides a standard way to access and manipulate web documents,
    ensuring that your scripts can run across different browsers with minimal
    issues.

    SEO and Accessibility -->

    Proper manipulation of the DOM can enhance a web page's SEO and make it more
    accessible to users with disabilities by ensuring elements are correctly
    structured and interactive.

    Prerequisites for Learning the DOM !

    HTML -->

    A strong understanding of HTML is crucial because the DOM represents the
    structure of an HTML document. Knowing how HTML elements are structured
    will help you navigate and manipulate the DOM.

    CSS -->

    Basic knowledge of CSS is needed to style the elements you manipulate in
    the DOM. Understanding how to apply classes and inline styles via JavaScript
    is important.
    
    JavaScript -->

    Familiarity with JavaScript is essential as it’s the primary language used
    to interact with the DOM. You should know the basics of JavaScript, including
    variables, functions, loops, and conditionals.

    Basic Programming Concepts -->

    Understanding basic programming concepts like variables, functions, objects,
    and arrays will help you manipulate the DOM effectively.

    Browser DevTools -->

    Knowing how to use the browser’s Developer Tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) will
    assist you in inspecting the DOM, debugging JavaScript code, and testing
    changes in real-time.

    Summary ----#

    Studying the DOM is essential for web developers because it enables you to
    create dynamic, interactive, and responsive web applications.
    By understanding the DOM, you can control the structure, content, and style
    of web pages programmatically, allowing you to build more engaging and
    user-friendly websites

    Execution !

    From now, we will use HTML to learn DOM
    We will run HTMl files instead of node
    There is an extension called Live Server On VS Code
    You can install that to run HTML file with Go Live button at bottom bar
